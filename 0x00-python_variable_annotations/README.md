## Overview
This project focuses on Python variable annotations, a feature introduced in Python 3 that allows developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. By using type annotations, code becomes more self-documenting and easier to understand. The tasks in this project involve writing type-annotated functions and defining variables with specific types.

## Concepts
The main concept covered in this project is **Advanced Python**.

## Resources
Before starting the project, it's recommended to review the following resources:
- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you're expected to achieve the following learning objectives:
- Understand type annotations in Python 3.
- Utilize type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
- Grasp the concept of duck typing.
- Learn to validate code with MyPy.

## Requirements
The project has specific requirements to ensure consistency and quality:
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (pycodestyle version 2.5).
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Ensure all files are executable.
- Document modules, classes, and functions appropriately.
- Use meaningful variable names and adhere to specified types.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Basic Annotations - Add
Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two floats as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1: Basic Annotations - Concat
Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two strings as arguments and returns their concatenation.

### Task 2: Basic Annotations - Floor
Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float as argument and returns its floor value as an integer.

### Task 3: Basic Annotations - To String
Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float as argument and returns its string representation.

### Task 4: Define Variables
Define and annotate specified variables with their respective values and types.

### Task 5: Complex Types - List of Floats
Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` that takes a list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 6: Complex Types - Mixed List
Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 7: Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple
Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string and an int or float as arguments and returns a tuple.

### Task 8: Complex Types - Functions
Write a type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the given multiplier.

### Task 9: Let's Duck Type an Iterable Object
Annotate the parameters and return values of a function `element_length` with appropriate types.

For detailed implementation and code examples, refer to the respective files in the project directory.
